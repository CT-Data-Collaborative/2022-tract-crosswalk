Census tract crosswalk to town, county, county equivalent, zipcode, and PUMA (2010)

The data/2022tractcrosswalk.csv file contains a crosswalk between Connecticut census tracts, towns, counties, country equivelents, ZIP Codes, and PUMAS (2010) in CT.

Note about FIPS Codes and County Equivalents

In 2022, the Census Bureau adopted county equivalents- Connecticut's nine planning regions- as new county-level geographies for Connecticut for statistical purposes, replacing Connecticut's eight counties for Census Bureau data products. The county equivalents have new FIPS codes. 

Census Bureau data and publications will transition to using the county equivalents instead of counties throughout 2023-2024. To help ease this transition, this crosswalk includes FIPS codes for both the counties and the new county equivalents. Tracts and towns therefore have two fips each:




By 2024, all Census Bureau operations and publications, both internal and external, will use the nine new county-equivalent boundaries, names, and codes, except for 2020 Decennial Census data publications and other datasets referencing the eight legacy counties as published before June 1, 2022.

Note that some tracts cross zip boundaries, therefore this crosswalk is approximate. 

The 2020 crosswalk contains 879 tracts and the 2010 crosswalk contains 829 tracts.
